# Backstory:
 Your team has been contracted to develop an inventory management system for a global warehouse company. This company specializes in storing and delivering a wide variety of items to customers worldwide. They are seeking to streamline their operations and enhance user experience through an effective inventory management system. Your task is to create a web-accessible inventory management system using Django.

# Objectives:
 The client’s requirements for the inventory management system are as follows:

    - User Interface (UI): The system should have a user-friendly interface.

    - Access Control: The system should only grant access to authorized personnel.

    - Order Simulation: The system should be able to simulate customer orders. This includes features such as adding items to a cart and calculating the total cost.

    - Search Functionality: The system should allow users to search the product inventory.

    - Inventory Alerts: The system should alert users when inventory levels are low.

    - CRUD Operations: The system should allow Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations across all database tables for authorized users.
    
    - Data Display: The system should be able to display stored data from selected tables and display related data (e.g., customer name and orders).
    
    - Popularity Metrics: The system should be able to display the most and least popular items.

# Database Tables:

Employee
Customer
Product
Order
Warehouse

# Additional Information:

- Use Django’s ORM for database operations.
- Use SQLite for simplicity. 

# Tips:

    - Assign roles within your team (e.g., Project Manager, Lead Developer, UI/UX Designer, Quality Assurance...) to simulate real-world team dynamics.

    - Implement user authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized personnel can access the system.

    - Review each other’s code to learn from each other and improve your code quality.

    - Prepare a short presentation to showcase your system and explain your design decisions at the end of the exercise.
